## Which Tech Stacks are used?

To bring our vision of an inclusive and sustainable robot to life, we integrated an array of cutting-edge technologies, each meticulously chosen to enhance functionality while maintaining accessibility. At the heart of our robot lies 3D printing technology, allowing for customizable and cost-effective components. The robot is controlled by combination of microcontrollers (Arduino Mega), enriched by the versatility of servo motors ensuring precise movement.

For cognition and interaction, we integrated OpenAI’s API along with our own AI models, making it possible for the robot to learn specific tasks and enhance its understanding. In tandem with AWS Polly, the robot possesses a voice that is not only comprehensible but also soothing, fostering seamless communication with humans.

With technologies like OpenCV combined with OAK-D Lite along with a suite of sensors ensure our robot remains receptive to its environment. In addition to these components, we created our own interface and designed custom PCBs to streamline the circuitry. All these elements come together, offering a perfect blend of innovation and functionality, making our humanoid robot not just a marvel of technology but also a testament to open-source innovation and accessibility.
